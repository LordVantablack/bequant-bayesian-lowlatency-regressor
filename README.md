# bequant-bayesian-lowlatency-regressor
A Bayesian regression model in C++ with an emphasis on low-latency implementation.


Building and Running
Build the project:
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make



Run the executable: The build process creates a binary named bayesian_regressor inside the build folder. Run it with:
./bayesian_regressor
Note: Currently, running this executes a hardcoded test case to verify the math logic.
